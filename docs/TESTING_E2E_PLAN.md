# Testing plan — integration & E2E

Layered strategy to cover what the offline unit suite (Vitest, `pnpm test`)
can't: **RLS enforcement** and **real user journeys** against live Postgres/Auth.

## Layers

### Layer 1 — RLS / integration (no browser) — **implemented (Phase 1), gated**
Real `@supabase/supabase-js` against a **dedicated test Supabase project**. Users
are provisioned confirmed via the service-role admin API, then RLS boundaries are
asserted with anon-key clients carrying each user's JWT.

- Files: `tests/integration/` (`helpers.ts`, `rls.test.ts`).
- Config: `vitest.integration.config.ts`; run with `pnpm test:integration`.
- **Gated:** skips unless `INTEGRATION_SUPABASE_*` env vars are set (see below),
  so the offline `pnpm test` unit run never touches the network.

Covered: `profiles`, `learner_profiles`, `quiz_sessions`, `attempts`, `reports`
owner-scoping; `topics` public read + **active**-only `questions` (inactive stay
hidden); `teacher_resources` owner-only + admin-read-all; `beta_leads`
public-insert / no-public-read / admin-read. Fixtures (a throwaway topic +
active/inactive questions) are created and torn down per run.

### Layer 2 — E2E (Playwright)

**Phase 2a — implemented & runnable (no backend needed).** `pnpm test:e2e`
(`e2e/`, config in `playwright.config.ts`) drives real Chromium against the app,
which is booted with **placeholder Supabase env** so it never touches a real
project. Covered: public marketing (landing hero + CTAs, pricing→`/beta?plan=`,
beta plan preselect + required-field validation) and routing/protection
(unauthenticated protected routes → sign-in; legacy `/login`, `/signup`,
`/practice` redirects). No writes — read-only navigation only.

**Phase 2b — auth journeys (planned, gated).** Sign-in → onboarding→diagnostic,
learner core loop, teacher generator, admin CRUD. These need a dedicated test
project: set `E2E_SUPABASE_*` (the config passes them to the server) and
pre-provision confirmed users via the service-role admin API, so production
email-confirmation stays on.

First run only: install the browser with `pnpm exec playwright install chromium`.

### Layer 3 — CI — **not started**
A GitHub Actions workflow (none exists today) running unit tests on every push,
and the gated integration/e2e suites when the test-project secrets are configured.

## Running the integration suite

Point it at a **dedicated, non-production** Supabase project that has all
migrations + the seed applied:

```bash
export INTEGRATION_SUPABASE_URL="https://<test-project>.supabase.co"
export INTEGRATION_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="<test anon key>"
export INTEGRATION_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="<test service-role key>"
pnpm test:integration
```

Without these, the suite **skips** (0 failures). It uses distinct env var names
(`INTEGRATION_*`) — not the app's `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` — specifically so it
can never accidentally run against the app's normal/production project. Each run
creates uniquely-named users and cleans them up in `afterAll`.

| E2E Phase 2a (marketing + routing/protection) | ✅ Implemented & passing (placeholder backend) |
| E2E Phase 2b (auth journeys) | ⬜ Planned (needs a test project) |
| CI workflow | ⬜ Planned |
