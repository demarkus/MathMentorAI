# Beta Smoke Test — Math Mentor AI

End-to-end manual checklist for verifying the app before and during early beta.
Run against a database that has all migrations applied and `supabase/seed.sql`
loaded (see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)). Related QA for the learning flow:
[LEARNING_EXPERIENCE_QA.md](LEARNING_EXPERIENCE_QA.md).

Legend: **Route** → **Expected result**.

## 1. Public marketing
- [ ] `/` → landing loads; hero CTAs go to `/beta`, `/pricing`, `/auth/sign-up`; header links to `/pricing`, `/auth/sign-in`, `/auth/sign-up`.
- [ ] `/pricing` → all five plans render; each "Choose <plan>" deep-links to `/beta?plan=<id>`.
- [ ] `/beta` → form loads; when arriving with `?plan=` the plan is preselected and named.
- [ ] `/beta` submit with a blank name / invalid email / no plan → a clear inline error (server-validated); no row created.
- [ ] `/beta` valid submit → success state ("You're on the list!"); a `beta_leads` row is created.

## 2. Auth & routing
- [ ] `/auth/sign-up` → can create **learner**, **parent**, **teacher** accounts. **Admin is NOT offered** (provisioned out-of-band only).
- [ ] After sign-up, a `profiles` row exists with the correct role (learner stored as `student`).
- [ ] Email-confirmation path: if confirmation is on, user is sent to sign-in with a "check your email" message; `/auth/callback?code=…` exchanges the code and lands on `/dashboard`.
- [ ] `/dashboard` → redirects by role: student→`/learner`, parent→`/parent`, teacher→`/teacher`, admin→`/admin`; no role→`/onboarding`.
- [ ] `/auth/sign-out` → session cleared, redirected to sign-in.
- [ ] Legacy redirects: `/login`→`/auth/sign-in`, `/signup`→`/auth/sign-up`, `/practice`→`/learner/practice`, `/auth/signout`→`/auth/sign-out`.
- [ ] Unauthenticated access to `/learner`, `/parent`, `/teacher`, `/admin` → redirected to sign-in.
- [ ] Wrong-role access (e.g. learner → `/admin`) → redirected to `/dashboard`.

## 3. Learner
- [ ] `/learner` → dashboard renders for the learner.
- [ ] `/learner/topics` → seeded topics listed, grouped by grade.
- [ ] `/learner/topics/<valid-slug>` → topic detail with active-question count.
- [ ] `/learner/topics/<invalid-slug>` → not-found (no crash).
- [ ] `/learner/diagnostic` → question set loads across Grade 9/10.
- [ ] Diagnostic submit → session, attempts, and report persist (when tables present); result page shows score, band, and next steps.
- [ ] `/learner/diagnostic/result` with no data → empty state with CTAs.
- [ ] `/learner/practice` → topic list; choosing a topic loads a practice set.
- [ ] `/learner/practice/<topicSlug>` → check/answer reveals feedback (hint, worked steps); submit reaches the result page.
- [ ] Practice result → score, band, mistakes (question, learner answer, correct answer, worked steps), next-step CTAs.
- [ ] `/learner/progress` with no attempts → empty state (does not crash).
- [ ] `/learner/progress` after attempts → stats, strengths/focus, topic table, recent activity.

## 4. Parent (privacy-critical)
- [ ] `/parent`, `/parent/reports`, `/parent/reports/<anyId>` → require the parent role.
- [ ] All parent pages are **placeholder-only** — no learner data is queried or shown.
- [ ] `/parent/reports/<learnerId>` ignores the id entirely and shows a "secure linking required" message (no data exposure).

## 5. Teacher (ownership-critical)
- [ ] `/teacher`, `/teacher/generator`, `/teacher/resources`, `/teacher/resources/<id>` → require the teacher role.
- [ ] Generator loads topics; validates grade, topic, question count, difficulty, and resource type server-side.
- [ ] Generated resource displays clearly (questions + answer memo) and the **Print** button works (chrome hidden via `print:hidden`).
- [ ] Saving writes to `teacher_resources` with `teacher_id` = current teacher (degrades gracefully with a note if the table is absent).
- [ ] `/teacher/resources` lists **only the current teacher's** resources.
- [ ] `/teacher/resources/<owned-id>` → opens. `/teacher/resources/<other-teacher-or-bogus-id>` → not-found (never another teacher's data).

## 6. Admin
- [ ] `/admin`, `/admin/topics`, `/admin/questions`, `/admin/questions/new`, `/admin/questions/<id>/edit` → require the admin role.
- [ ] `/admin/topics` → topic catalogue lists (read-only).
- [ ] `/admin/questions` → question list with grade/topic/difficulty filters.
- [ ] Create question uses actual schema fields: `topic_id, grade, question_text, answer_text, hint, solution_steps, difficulty, marks, is_active`.
- [ ] Edit question saves; deactivating (`is_active = false`) hides it from learners without deleting.
- [ ] `/admin/questions/<invalid-id>/edit` → not-found (no crash).

## 7. Environment & security
- [ ] No `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` anywhere (project standardises on the anon key).
- [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is read only in `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`; no `"use client"` file imports the server client.
- [ ] No stray `console.log` / `TODO` / `.DS_Store` committed (`.DS_Store` is gitignored).
- [ ] Protected pages and server actions call `requireRole(...)`.
- [ ] `beta_leads`: public **insert** only, no public read. Parent routes never read learner data.

### Database verification (SQL editor)
```sql
-- Seed counts (post clear-baseline seed)
select count(*) as topics from public.topics;                 -- expect 14
select grade, count(*) from public.questions group by grade;  -- expect 9 -> 54, 10 -> 54

-- No self-assigned admins from public sign-up (expect 0 unless provisioned on purpose)
select count(*) as admins from public.profiles where role = 'admin';

-- beta_leads accepts public inserts but not public reads
select tablename, cmd, roles from pg_policies
where schemaname = 'public' and tablename = 'beta_leads' order by cmd;

-- teacher_resources is owner-scoped (+ admin select)
select policyname, cmd, roles from pg_policies
where schemaname = 'public' and tablename = 'teacher_resources' order by cmd;

-- A beta lead was captured (after submitting the /beta form)
select full_name, email, role, selected_plan, created_at
from public.beta_leads order by created_at desc limit 5;
```

## Known limitations (non-blocking)
- **Parent–learner linking is unbuilt** — parent reports are placeholders by design.
- **Diagnostic result shows no per-question review** — correct answers are never sent to the client for the diagnostic; per-question review is practice-only.
- **Answer checking is string-based** (with limited `x = 5` ↔ `5` tolerance) — mathematically-equivalent-but-differently-written answers may be marked incorrect. No AI marking.
- **No server-side idempotency on quiz submit** — a double-submit could duplicate a session/attempts/report; client pending-state mitigates.
- **Best-effort persistence uses the service-role client** — safe only because it is always preceded by `requireRole(...)` and server-derived ownership.

## Beta blocker list
- [x] **Public sign-up could self-assign the `admin` role** (privilege escalation to question-bank CRUD). **Fixed** — admin removed from the sign-up form and rejected server-side (`PUBLIC_SIGNUP_ROLES` falls back to `student`).

## Non-blocking follow-ups
- Add `required`/inline client validation on the beta form for faster feedback (server validation already blocks bad input).
- Add a dedup key for quiz submissions to guard against double-submits.
- Build secure parent–learner linking, then populate the parent report components.
- Add auth/role and RLS smoke tests to lock in the access model.
